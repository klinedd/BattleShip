The purpose of this project is to establish a wireless connection between two BeagleBones that will run a game of BattleShip. We will be using pygame to "play" the game and use rotary encoders and push buttons through the BeagleBone ports, or by the use of the enter key and arrow keys from the computer keyboard. The direction inputs will allow the user to move their location on the board to first place ships in the directions of up, down, left, and right, and then move their location to shoot ships of their opponent.
This is the readme file for the BattleShip project. Any information needed to 
run any code for this project should be placed here.
